    <h4> INTRODUCTIONS</h4>
    <p> Hello! My name is Carmina.
        I was born in Chicago, but I lived most of childhood in Zion/Waukegan area which is close to the Wisconsin border. I grew up alongside my 2 brothers (1 younger and 1 older) and my eldest sister. 
        Since last year, my dad welcomed a pandemic baby boy into our lives, so it definitely has been interesting.I also have a 9 month old cat named Melatonin but Mela for short. <br>
    <br> I am currently majoring in Aviation Adminstration with a minor in Aircraft Dispatch.
        In this field, I hope to continue what I haved learned to a position in the military or even working for the FAA.
    </p>
    <h4>WHAT I HOPE TO LEARN IN THIS COURSE</h4> 
    <ul>
        <Li>Python</Li>
        <li>HTML and CSS</li>
        <Li>Artifical Intelligence</Li>
        <li>Overall understanding of computers and how it works </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>MY FAVORITE HOBBY/ACTIVITY</h4>
    <p> I enjoy collecting Pokemon cards, I think my favorite thing about itis that within every pack you never know what
        you're going to get because there are times you'll get one super rare card or one that is common card. 
        I also think it's such a versitle community that literally anyone can get into or even relate to, and it's just one of those things that 
        so many people in this world  know about. 
        Like whether it is children or older age, there is community of us that just know what it is.
    </p>
    <h4>FUN FACT</h4>
    <p>If I had the oppurtunity to choose what I would be reincarnated to in my next life,
        I would probably be either a plant or someone's pet. 
        That way if I were a plant, all I had to do all day is photosynthsize. 
        <br> Or a pet, all I have to do is eat, sleep, play, and the occassion of using the bathroom.
    </p>
